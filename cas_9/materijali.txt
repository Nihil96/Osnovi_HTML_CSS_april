----------- Responsive Design -----------

Responsive design is an approach to web design that aims to create a website that can adjust and 
adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This means that the website will look good and be 
usable on a desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone, regardless of the screen size or 
orientation.

Responsive design typically involves using fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries to 
adjust the layout and content of the website based on the size of the screen. This can include 
changing the size and position of elements, hiding or showing certain elements, and changing 
the font size and line height.

The goal of responsive design is to create a consistent user experience across all devices, 
and to ensure that the website is easy to use and navigate, no matter how it is accessed.


----------- Media Query --------------

A media query is a CSS technique that allows styles to be applied based on the characteristics 
of the device being used to view a web page. In other words, it's a way of specifying different 
styles for different devices, screen sizes, and orientations. Media queries can be used to 
create responsive designs that adjust their layout and styling to provide the best possible 
user experience on different devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.

Media queries are defined using the @media rule in CSS, and they allow you to specify 
different styles for different viewport sizes. For example, you might define a media 
query that applies a different font size and layout for screens that are smaller than 
768 pixels wide. When a device's screen size matches the conditions specified in the media 
query, the styles defined within that media query are applied to the page.

Most often, max-width and min-width are used in the media query when developing 
a responsive web sites.

- max-width: applies styles when the screen width is less than or equal to a specified value.
- min-width: applies styles when the screen width is greater than or equal to a specified value.

In other words, max-width is used to target smaller screens, while min-width is used to 
target larger screens.

For example, if you want to apply a specific style to screens that are 768px wide or 
smaller, you would use max-width: 768px. If you want to apply a style to screens that 
are 769px or wider, you would use min-width: 769px.
