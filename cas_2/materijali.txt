HTML TAGS:

- <a/> - The <a> tag is an HTML element used to create a hyperlink or a link to 
another web page, a file, or a location on the same page. The "a" stands for "anchor", 
and it is also known as the anchor tag.

- <ol></ol> - The <ol> tag is used to create an ordered list, which is a list of 
items where each item is numbered or ordered in some way.

- <ul></ul> - The <ul> tag, on the other hand, is used to create an unordered 
list, which is a list of items where each item is not ordered or numbered in any particular way. 

- <li></li> - The <li> tag is an HTML element used to represent a single item
in a list. It stands for "list item" and is used within <ol> (ordered list) or <ul> (unordered list) tags to define each individual item in the list.

- <header></header> - The <header> tag is an HTML element used to define the 
header section of a web page or a section of it. The header section typically 
contains introductory content, such as a logo, a navigation menu, a search bar,
or other elements that appear at the top of a web page.

- <nav></nav> - The <nav> tag is an HTML element used to define a section of a
web page that contains navigation links to other pages or sections of the same page. 
The <nav> element can be used within the <header> or <footer> tags, or within the 
<body> tag to define a specific navigation section within the content of the web page.

- <table></table> - The <table> tag is an HTML element used to create tables on a 
web page. Tables are used to display data in rows and columns, making it easier 
for users to read and compare information.

- <caption></caption> - The <caption> tag is an HTML element that is used to add a 
title or a caption to an HTML table. It is usually placed directly below the <table> tag, 
but before the <thead> tag, if present. The <caption> tag can contain any text, 
including HTML tags, and can be styled using CSS.

- <thead></thead> - The <thead> tag is an HTML element that is used to define the 
header section of an HTML table. It is typically used to group together the table's 
header content, which is usually the first row or rows of the table that contain column headings.

-<tbody> - The tbody tag, is used to group a set of table rows (defined by the tr tag) 
that make up the body of a table. 

-<tr> - The tr tag, or table row tag, is used to define a row of cells within a table. 
It is a container element that must be used within a table (table) or table body (tbody) tag. 
Each row can contain one or more table data cells (td) or table header cells (th) that 
define the content of the cell.

-<td> - The td tag, or table data cell tag, is used to define a cell in a table 
that contains data. It must be used within a table row (tr) tag. The content of 
the td element can be text, images, links, or other HTML elements. It can also have 
attributes such as colspan and rowspan to span across multiple columns or rows within the table.
