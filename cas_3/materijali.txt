============== HTML FORMS =================


Examples and explanations:

-------- <input type="email" name="e-mail" id="e-mail" /> --------

This line of code creates an <input> element with three attributes: type, name, and id.

The TYPE attribute is set to "email", which indicates that this input is intended for 
entering an email address. This can provide some validation checks on the entered email 
address to ensure that it is in a valid format.

The NAME attribute is set to "e-mail", which is the name of the input control that will
be sent to the server when the form is submitted. The server can then use this name to 
identify the email address that was entered.

The ID attribute is set to "e-mail", which provides a unique identifier for the input element. 
This can be used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the input control.

Overall, this line of code creates an email input control with the name "e-mail" 
and the ID "e-mail", which can be used for validation and identification purposes.



HTML TAGS

- <form></form> - The <form> tag is an HTML element used to create a container for 
interactive input elements, such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, buttons, and more. 
It is used to collect user input and send it to a server for further processing.

The <form> tag has two main attributes: action and method.

The ACTION attribute specifies where the form data should be sent for processing. This is 
typically a URL that points to a server-side script that will process the form data.

The METHOD attribute specifies how the form data should be sent to the server. 
There are two possible values for this attribute: GET and POST. When using GET, 
the form data is appended to the URL as a query string, while with POST, the form 
data is sent in the request body.

- <input /> - The <input> element is a fundamental form element in HTML used to 
create a variety of form controls. It is a self-closing tag and can include several
attributes that define the behavior of the input control, such as type, name, value, 
placeholder, and more.

The most common input types are:

text: used to create a single-line text input field
password: used to create a single-line password input field
email: used to create a single-line email input field
checkbox: used to create a checkbox control
radio: used to create a radio button control
submit: used to create a submit button control

- <label></label> - The <label> tag is another fundamental form element in HTML that 
is used to associate a label with an input control. The label is used to describe 
the purpose of the input control, and is typically displayed alongside the control.

-<button></button> - The <button> tag is used to create a clickable button on a web page. 
The button can perform different actions when clicked, such as submitting a form or triggering 
some JavaScript function. The <button> tag can contain text or other HTML elements, such as 
images or icons, to provide additional context or visual cues to the user.

- <textarea></textarea> The <textarea> tag in HTML is used to create a multi-line input 
field where users can enter text. Unlike the <input> tag which is used for single-line 
inputs, the <textarea> tag can accept multiple lines of text.

- <select></select> - The <select> tag in HTML is used to create a drop-down list of 
options that users can choose from. It is often used in HTML forms to allow users to 
select one or more options from a list.

- <option> - The <option> tag is used to define the options that appear in a drop-down 
list created with the <select> tag. Each option is defined with an <option> tag, and 
the content of the tag is the text that appears in the list for that option.

- <optgroup></optgroup> - The <optgroup> tag is used to group related options in a 
drop-down list created with the <select> tag. It is a child element of the <select> 
tag and can contain one or more <option> tags. 

-<fieldset></fieldset> - The <fieldset> tag is an HTML container element that is 
used to group related form elements together. It can be used to visually separate 
the form fields into logical sections or categories.

- <div></div> - The div tag is used to create a block-level container element that 
groups other HTML elements together. It is used to divide sections of a webpage into 
distinct and meaningful parts, such as header, navigation, content, and footer. 
The div tag has a default display property of block, which means it starts on a 
new line and takes up the entire width available. The div tag is often used with 
CSS styling to apply a common style to multiple elements within the container.

- <span></span> - The span tag is used to create an inline-level container element 
that is used to group inline-level elements together. It is often used to apply styles 
to a small portion of text, such as a single word or phrase within a paragraph. 
The span tag has a default display property of inline, which means it does not start 
on a new line and only takes up the width of its contents.
