--------- Box Model -----------

The box model is a concept in web design that describes how elements are displayed on a webpage 
in a rectangular box. It consists of four parts: content, padding, border, and margin.

The content area is the space where the actual content of the element is displayed, 
such as text or images. The padding is the space between the content and the border, 
and it can be used to add space within an element. The border is a line that surrounds 
the content and padding, and it can be used to add visual style or to create a boundary 
around an element. The margin is the space between the border of an element and other 
elements on the page, and it can be used to create spacing between elements.

The box model is important to understand when creating and designing web pages, as it 
allows developers and designers to control the size, position, and spacing of elements 
on the page. By adjusting the values of the content, padding, border, and margin, designers 
can create a variety of different layouts and designs.


CSS properties:

- Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.

1. Named colors: CSS supports 147 named colors, such as "red", "green", "blue", "orange", etc.

2. Hexadecimal colors: A hexadecimal color is a six-digit code that represents the amount of red, 
green, and blue in a color. For example, #FF0000 is the hexadecimal code for red.

3. RGB colors: RGB stands for red, green, blue. In CSS, you can define colors using the RGB color
model, which consists of three values: the amount of red, green, and blue in the color. 
For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is the RGB value for red.

4. RGBA colors: RGBA stands for red, green, blue, alpha. The alpha value determines the opacity 
of the color. For example, rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5) is a red color with 50% opacity.

5. HSL colors: HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. Hue is a degree on 
the color wheel, saturation is the amount of gray in the color, and lightness is the 
amount of white or black in the color. For example, hsl(0, 100%, 50%) is a pure red color.

6. HSLA colors: HSLA stands for hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha. The alpha value 
determines the opacity of the color. For example, hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5) is a pure red 
color with 50% opacity.


- border - The CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color 
of an element's border.

- The border-radius property is used to add rounded borders to an element

- margin is used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

- padding is used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.

- height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.

- outline is a line drawn outside the element's border.

-box-sizing - is a CSS property that controls how the total width and height of an element 
is calculated. It determines whether an element's width and height should include the 
padding and border or not.

The box-sizing property can have two possible values:

content-box (default): This is the default value where the width and height of the 
element only include the content area, excluding the padding and border. In other words, 
the specified width and height values do not account for any additional space taken up by 
the padding or border.

border-box: With this value, the width and height of the element include the content, 
padding, and border. In this case, the specified width and height values represent the 
total size of the element, including any padding and border. The content area will be 
adjusted to fit within this total size.

Using box-sizing: border-box is often recommended as it simplifies the sizing calculations,
especially when working with complex layouts. It allows you to set explicit dimensions for 
elements without worrying about the additional space taken up by padding and border.



---------- Generic Font Families ------------

In CSS there are five generic font families:

- Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
- Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
- Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
- Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
- Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
